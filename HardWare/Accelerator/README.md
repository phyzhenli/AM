# DNN accelerators with 8-bit unsigned multiplier

## SA [1]

Top module is systolic_array and the multiplier can be changed in 'multiplier.v'.

The names of clock and reset signals are 'clk' and 'rst_n' respectively.

## SC [1]

Top module is systolic_cube_without_fifo and the multiplier can be changed in 'mad_unit_test.v'.

The names of clock and reset signals are 'iClk' and 'iRst' respectively.

## TASU [3]

Top module is conv0 and the multiplier can be changed in "mad_unit_test.v".

The names of clock and reset signals are 'clk' and 'rst_n' respectively.
