# Adaptable Approximate Multiplier Design Driven by Input Distribution and Polarity

## [ApproxFlow](https://github.com/FDU-ME-ARC/ApproxFlow)

ApproxFlow is a toolbox to evaluate the DNN accuracy with the approximate multiplier. In ApproxFlow, each approximate multiplier is described by a look-up table. A DNN is represented by a directional acyclic graph (DAG), where each vertex denotes a DNN layer and the edges indicate the data flow. When a vertex in the DAG is executed, its dependencies will be executed automatically.
