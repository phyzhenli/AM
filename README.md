# Adaptable Approximate Multiplier Design Driven by Input Distribution and Polarity

This repository contains three parts:
 - ApproxFlow: a toolbox  evaluate the DNN accuracy with approximate multiplier.
 - HardWare: Verilog descriptions of All compared multipliers and generated multipliers.
 - SoftWare: the code of our optimization method.
