# Adaptable Approximate Multiplier Design Driven by Input Distribution and Polarity

This repository contains three parts:
 - ApproxFlow: a toolbox to evaluate the DNN accuracy with the approximate multiplier.
 - HardWare: Verilog descriptions of multipliers and accelerators.
 - SoftWare: the code of our optimization method.
